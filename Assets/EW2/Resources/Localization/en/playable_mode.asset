      this mode, you can control up to 5 heroes.


      You can only control heroes
      and cannot build towers.


      The goal is to defend an alliance base. When
      the base is destroyed, the game is over. Bases will help you level up your
      heroes right in the middle of a battle. Unlock new bases to equip heroes with
      passive skills.


      You can use gold to upgrade the Hero''s stats right
      in the battle. Tap to the Base on the map to upgrade.


      You will receive
      rewards according to each achievement milestone. Defend as long as you can
      to get more valuable rewards.


      Maps and leaderboards will be refreshed
      every season. Be prepared to face new challenges.'
