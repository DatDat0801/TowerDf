Unlock new bases to equip heroes with passive skills.\n\nYou can use gold to upgrade the Hero's stats right in the battle. Tap to the Base on the map to upgrade.\n\nYou will receive rewards according to each achievement milestone. Defend as long as you can to get more valuable rewards.\n\nMaps and leaderboards will be refreshed every season. Be prepared to face new challenges.
